This project demonstrates the mathematical derivation and Python implementation of Multiple Linear Regression â€” a fundamental algorithm in supervised machine learning used for predicting a continuous target variable based on multiple input features.
Implementing the regression from scratch (no libraries like scikit-learn)

Calculating model parameters using matrix operations

Predicting output for new data

Evaluating model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
